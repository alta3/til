# Change the base branch of a pull request

Say, for example, a teammate missed the merge window for a release but issued their PR to the base branch
of the previous release branch.  Fret not, for you can fix this problem by simply changing the base branch
of the Pull Request for them!

1. Under your repository name, click  Pull requests.
0. In the "Pull Requests" list, click the pull request you'd like to modify.
0. Next to the pull request's title, click Edit.
0. In the base branch drop-down menu, select the base branch you'd like to compare changes against.
0. Read the information about changing the base branch and click Change base.
